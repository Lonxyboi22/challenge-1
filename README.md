## Project Description
```
This project is to demonstrate 
refactoring in the web develompent 
field. In this challenge, I refactored 
the original code in order to make the 
code easier to read and run more 
efficiently. Refactoring code allows 
for cleaner and more easily read code. 

In this challenge I changed a majority 
of <div> function pieces to their more 
specific tags such as <main>, 
<section>, <footer>, etc. The tags 
however did not interact with the 
styling or the functionality of the 
web page. The nice thing about 
changing the tags in the html document 
would be that it comes across as 
cleaner and more managable. 

I also in this assignment changed/
condensed the CSS code. Doing so it 
leads to a more functionally sound and 
easily read file. In that portion of 
the exercise, I mostly looked for 
repeating code and then edited the 
classes/added a new class in order to 
condense the existing CSS code. 

Below are the user story and the 
acceptance criteria I had to follow. 

```

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
